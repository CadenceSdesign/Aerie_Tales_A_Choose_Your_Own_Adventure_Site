Aerie Tales, A choose your own adventure website. A mini story is displayed, and two choices are given to the user. 

When a choice button is clicked, the result of the mini story is displayed, the choice buttons removed, and a continue button is displayed. When the continue button is clicked, it is removed, the next mini story is displayed, and a new “jump to” is added to the menu for the new section. 

The results of each mini story are kept track of in the form of stats. For example, a mini story where the user selected being calm, the “calm” variable would be increased by one. 

Upon completion of all the mini stories, an overall ending is generated based off the stats and then displayed to the user.

Based on the Bootstrap – Agency template.
